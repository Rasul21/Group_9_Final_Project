# Analysis of Video Games Sales


The Dataset can be found on the following link: https://github.com/knpraveen/VideoGameSales/blob/master/vgsales.csv

The goal of this project is to analyze the video games market by reviewing its most popular successes. We will start by investigating the sales of the most famous titles existing and review their contents, genre and region where they were created. We will also analyze the largest video games producers and the platforms through which the games are accessible (PC, PS, XBOX, Nintendo, and so on). Hopefully, we will be able to identify which platform and genre contribute to the success of the video game.

The main questions are:

-	What are the most popular games of all time?
-	What genres tend to conquer the audience attention?
-	What regions contribute mostly to video gaming market?
-	What platform is rich in terms of famous video game titles?
-	How the video games market changed over time?

To successfully answer these questions we will use the following variables provided in the dataset:

-	Sales (by regions)
-	Genre of the game 
-	Release date
-	Publisher
-	Platform (used to play the game)
